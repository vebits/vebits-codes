            and provides an overview of the different features.

            <br />
            Strata explores the field of geology and more specifically rock
            layering. In the physical world, layered rocks form when particles
            settle from water or air. These layers of sedimentary rock are
            called strata. In the digital world, the Strata algorithm generates
            layer upon layer of colors to draw the impression of rock layering.
            Each token hash decides the path Strata takes through the generative
            space to the final output.
